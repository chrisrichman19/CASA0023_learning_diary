## Reflection

Xaringan presentations at first appear a lot more complex than comparable programs like PowerPoint and Slides, particularly when it comes to tasks like resizing images and restyling text. I think that it will take a while to master all the syntax before it becomes intuitive.

I looked into the benefits of Xaringan, which its users claim make it more powerful than traditional presentation software like PowerPoint or Google Slides. For example, the ability to directly include R code and its output into slides is a big professed advantage for its user. However, at this stage, I am not yet convinced and remain unconverted.
