# Corrections and Enhancements

## Summary

This week, we explored the steps needed to turn raw satellite imagery into reliable, analysis-ready data. While remote sensing is powerful, I hadn’t fully appreciated just how technical image correction can be.

Modern remote sensing products like Landsat’s Analysis Ready Data (ARD) come pre-corrected. But it important to know what corrections are applied to these products. For example, Landsat offers three processing levels: Level 0 (minor ancillary corrections), Level 1 (radiometrically and geometrically corrected) and Level 2 (atmospherically corrected and terrain-adjusted) [@haque2024].

Depending on your needs

-   level 1 for if you want control over atmospheric corrections

-   level 2 - analysis ready - using ready made algorithms.

#### Corrections:

**Geometric correction**

Since satellites capture images from shifting orbits and angles, distortions can occur. This is often corrected by using Ground Control Points (GCPs) [@jensen2015]. Ground control points are location on the Earth's surface that can be accurately located and act as reference points [@jensen2015]. Algorithms match these GCPs in the captured image, which guide the transformations needed on the raw image to fix any distortions.

Both Landsat level 1 and 2 products match pixels from raw images to Earth’s coordinates using ground control points[@landsat2021].

though they note that "Scenes containing snow, ice, and clouds can prevent accurate registration of GCPs within a scene." [@landsat2017]

**Atmospheric correction:**

Light interacts with the atmosphere before reaching a sensor. Particles like dust, water vapor, and pollutants scatter and absorb light, affecting the captured image quality.

**Dark Object Subtraction (DOS)** is a common fix, which assumes that the darkest pixel represents atmospheric noise so that value is subtracted from every pixel.

Another method is using stable surfaces, like roads or rooftops, that maintain consistent reflectance over time. These are called **Pseudo-invariant features (PIFs)**. By assuming that these features do not change between images, researchers use them to adjust images.

These methods are refered to as *relative atmospheric correction* and is often used as an estimate in the absence of synchronised surface-reflectance data[@jensen2015].

Landsat level 2 removes atmospheric haze by adjusting for aerosols/water vapor data from a sensor (MODIS) onboard another NASA satellite [@landsat2021]. This method is more advanced than PIFs or DOS corrections because it uses real atmospheric measurements instead of assumptions or reference surfaces.

This is known as an *absolute atmospheric correction* method [@jensen2015].

**Orthorectification correction**

Elevation can distort imagery

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) adjust for terrain effects, ensuring images appear as if taken from directly above (nadir). Landsat 1 and 2 corrects terrain distortion using digital elevation models [@landsat2021].

However, tall buildings and bridges introduce their own artifacts, which are harder to correct as they are not included in standard DEMs [@earthsciencedatasystems2024].

**Radiometric calibration**

Converts raw sensor data to radiance values

## Application

**Remote Sensing Challenges and Corrections in Urban Environments**

I decided to focus on the distinct issues with remote sensing in urban areas, as I found that researchers often highlight challenges with collecting data in dense cities, so they often have to get creative with their solutions.

And with satellite imagery being increasingly used in urban settings for detecting land use change, transport planning, environmental monitoring, it is important that these images accurately reflect the real environment [@pradhan2021].

Urban areas often exhibit high intra-class variability, which mean that similar materials appear spectrally different, due to shadows, reflective surfaces and high-rise buildings, making classification challenging [@huang2011].

Some studies attempt to address this by fusing multi-angle satellite data (e.g., combining Landsat with Sentinel-2) or combining LiDAR data to create more accurate elevation models for cities. [@huang2011 ;@miliaresis2007].

[@huang2011] found that the height features obatined from LiDAR data significantly improved urban land-cover classification.

Urban areas also introduce shadowing effects, where buildings cast shadows that obscure features on the ground, making it difficult to classify land cover accurately [@dare2005; @le2020]. Researchers have addressed this by applying shadow detection and removal algorithms that estimate surface reflectance in obscured areas [@su2016].

Other

-   **Adjacency Effect**: Reflective surfaces (e.g., glass facades) scatter light into neighbouring pixels, skewing surface reflectance values.

-   **Thermal Anomalies**: Concrete and metal structures absorb/re-radiate heat differently than natural terrain, distorting temperature measurements. Particularly impactful for urban heat island research.

Yet gaps remain. Most of these urban corrections don't have out-of-the-box soluation as they are computationally intensive and require localised datasets (e.g., LiDAR), perhaps limiting real-time applications and scalability.

## Reflection

This week showed that image correction is a balance between precision and practicality. Methods like DOS or PIFs make corrections more accessible, but they also have limitations.

*relate to urban scenario too*

Pre-processed **Analysis Ready Data (ARD)**

—pre-corrected datasets that save time—but also made me question the assumptions behind vendor-applied corrections. What trade-offs are hidden in these standardised products? Can we always trust them without understanding their limitations? How does it affect comparison of products?

blackbox concerns - **Level 2 (ARD)** is “plug-and-play”, but you’re trusting NASA’s blackbox algorithms

working in urban research - researcher often use much more complicated solutions that are offered by products - integrating lidar, 3d models, combining different temporal sattellite images .
