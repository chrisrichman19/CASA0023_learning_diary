    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week, we looked at the fundamentals of remote sensing focusing on its technical workings, and applications. The focus was on understanding how electromagnetic energy is used to gather data about the Earth’s surface. The lectures introduced key concepts, including the electromagnetic spectrum, sensor types, and image processing techniques.\nRemote sensing is the science of obtaining information about the Earth’s via sensors. This information is obtained by sensors that observe energy, usually from the sun, reflected or emitted from the earth’s surface (Tempfli et al. 2009). This energy can be modelled as waves, where the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and energy. These sensors measure how different materials reflect or absorb energy at specific wavelengths. Remote sensing operates across bands on the electromagnetic spectrum, including wavelengths visible to the human eye and beyond, like near-infrared radiation. For example, healthy vegetation reflects a lot of near-infrared energy because of its cellular structure, while unhealthy vegetation reflects less (Butcher 2016). By analysing these spectral reflectance curves, scientists can identify spectral signatures for plant health, soil types, or water quality using specialised software such as SNAP and R (which we used in our practical).\nSensors can be passive, relying on naturally reflected sunlight, or active, emitting their own energy (e.g., radar). This capability allows scientists to gather data on vegetation health, land use, and atmospheric conditions (Tempfli et al. 2009).",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nIn the practical we looked at data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2; two of the most widely used Earth observation missions that provide freely available satellite data.\nLandsat 8, launched in 2013, offers a spatial resolution of 30 meters and 16-day revisit intervals (“Landsat 8 | u.s. Geological Survey,” n.d.). It captures imagery across nine spectral bands using its sensor (Operational Land Imager). It differs from Sentinel-2 as it captures thermal data at a resolution of 100 meters, making Landsat 8 particularly useful for studying surface temperature related phenomena such as urban heat islands and mapping glacier melting (Kaplan, Avdan, and Avdan 2018; Fahnestock et al. 2016)\nSentinel-2, launched in 2015 and 2017 as a dual-satellite mission, provides a more frequent revisit time of five days and captures data across 13 spectral bands at spatial resolutions ranging from 10 to 60 meters. Chaves et al., (2020) note how the red-edge bands are particularly good for assessing vegetation health. Sentinel-2 is excellent for detailed, real-time monitoring, making it a popular tool for researchers to assess natural disaster damage, and track seasonal changes in vegetation (Jelének and Kopačková-Strnadová 2021; Chaves, Picoli, and Sanches 2020)\nBoth Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 are great for monitoring Earth’s surface, but as mentioned in the paragraphs above, their sensors capture data slightly differently (Mandanici and Bitelli 2016). This means you need to be careful when combining data from the two sensors, taking into consideration the differences in bands and resolution.\nOverall, it is clear that this is an exciting time for remote sensing research - From a European Space Agency report, released at the beginning of 2025 research using ESA earth observation satellites has exploded since 2002 (ESSC 2025). “According to statistics provided by ESA, over 4,000 scientific publications utilising ESA and Sentinel satellites have been published in peer-reviewed journals in 2024 alone” (ESSC 2025, 42)\n\n\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESSC 2025)\n\n\nWhilst Landsat and Sentinel satellites dominant research due to their availability, there are also plenty of private commercial earth observation missions being launched by commercial companies as shown below.\n\n\n\nEO satellite companies (Aravind 2025)",

While remote sensing is powerful, I hadn’t fully appreciated just how technical image correction can be.\nModern remote sensing products like Landsat’s Analysis Ready Data (ARD) come pre-corrected. But it important to know what corrections are applied to these products. For example, Landsat offers three processing levels: Level 0 (minor ancillary corrections), Level 1 (radiometrically and geometrically corrected) and Level 2 (atmospherically corrected and terrain-adjusted) (Haque et al. 2024).\nDepending on your needs",

    "text": "3.2 Application\nRemote Sensing Challenges and Corrections in Urban Environments\nI decided to focus on the distinct issues with remote sensing in urban areas, as I found that researchers often highlight challenges with collecting data in dense cities, so they often have to get creative with their solutions.\nAnd with satellite imagery being increasingly used in urban settings for detecting land use change, transport planning, environmental monitoring, it is important that these images accurately reflect the real environment (Pradhan et al. 2021).\nUrban areas often exhibit high intra-class variability, which mean that similar materials appear spectrally different, due to shadows, reflective surfaces and high-rise buildings, making classification challenging (Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011).\nSome studies attempt to address this by fusing multi-angle satellite data (e.g., combining Landsat with Sentinel-2) or combining LiDAR data to create more accurate elevation models for cities. (Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011; Miliaresis and Kokkas 2007).\n(Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011) found that the height features obatined from LiDAR data significantly improved urban land-cover classification.\nUrban areas also introduce shadowing effects, where buildings cast shadows that obscure features on the ground, making it difficult to classify land cover accurately (Dare 2005; Le and Samaras 2020). Researchers have addressed this by applying shadow detection and removal algorithms that estimate surface reflectance in obscured areas (Su et al. 2016).\nOther\n\nAdjacency Effect: Reflective surfaces (e.g., glass facades) scatter light into neighbouring pixels, skewing surface reflectance values.\nThermal Anomalies: Concrete and metal structures absorb/re-radiate heat differently than natural terrain, distorting temperature measurements. Particularly impactful for urban heat island research.\n\nYet gaps remain. Most of these urban corrections don’t have out-of-the-box soluation as they are computationally intensive and require localised datasets (e.g., LiDAR), perhaps limiting real-time applications and scalability.",

This is often corrected by using Ground Control Points (GCPs) (Jensen 2015). Ground control points are location on the Earth’s surface that can be accurately located and act as reference points (Jensen 2015). Algorithms match these GCPs in the captured image, which guide the transformations needed on the raw image to fix any distortions.\nBoth Landsat level 1 and 2 products match pixels from raw images to Earth’s coordinates using ground control points(Landsat 2021).\nthough they note that “Scenes containing snow, ice, and clouds can prevent accurate registration of GCPs within a scene.” (“Landsat Levels of Processing | U.S. Geological Survey” 2017)\nAtmospheric correction:\nLight interacts with the atmosphere before reaching a sensor. Particles like dust, water vapor, and pollutants scatter and absorb light, affecting the captured image quality.\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS) is a common fix, which assumes that the darkest pixel represents atmospheric noise so that value is subtracted from every pixel.\nAnother method is using stable surfaces, like roads or rooftops, that maintain consistent reflectance over time. These are called Pseudo-invariant features (PIFs). By assuming that these features do not change between images, researchers use them to adjust images.\nThese methods are refered to as relative atmospheric correction and is often used as an estimate in the absence of synchronised surface-reflectance data(Jensen 2015).\nLandsat level 2 removes atmospheric haze by adjusting for aerosols/water vapor data from a sensor (MODIS) onboard another NASA satellite (Landsat 2021). This method is more advanced than PIFs or DOS corrections because it uses real atmospheric measurements instead of assumptions or reference surfaces.\nThis is known as an absolute atmospheric correction method (Jensen 2015).\nOrthorectification correction\nElevation can distort imagery\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) adjust for terrain effects, ensuring images appear as if taken from directly above (nadir). Landsat 1 and 2 corrects terrain distortion using digital elevation models (Landsat 2021).\nHowever, tall buildings and bridges introduce their own artifacts, which are harder to correct as they are not included in standard DEMs (Earth Science Data Systems 2024).\nRadiometric calibration\nConverts raw sensor data to radiance values",
