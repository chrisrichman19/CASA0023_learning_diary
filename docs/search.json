    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThis week, we looked at the fundamentals of remote sensing focusing on its technical workings, and applications. The focus was on understanding how electromagnetic energy is used to gather data about the Earth’s surface. The lectures introduced key concepts, including the electromagnetic spectrum, sensor types, and image processing techniques.\nRemote sensing is the science of obtaining information about the Earth’s via sensors. This information is obtained by sensors that observe energy, usually from the sun, reflected or emitted from the earth’s surface (Tempfli et al. 2009). This energy can be modelled as waves, where the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and energy. These sensors measure how different materials reflect or absorb energy at specific wavelengths. Remote sensing operates across bands on the electromagnetic spectrum, including wavelengths visible to the human eye and beyond, like near-infrared radiation. For example, healthy vegetation reflects a lot of near-infrared energy because of its cellular structure, while unhealthy vegetation reflects less (Butcher 2016). By analysing these spectral reflectance curves, scientists can identify spectral signatures for plant health, soil types, or water quality using specialised software such as SNAP and R (which we used in our practical).\nSensors can be passive, relying on naturally reflected sunlight, or active, emitting their own energy (e.g., radar). This capability allows scientists to gather data on vegetation health, land use, and atmospheric conditions (Tempfli et al. 2009).\nReflecting on this introductory week, the power of remote sensing is apparent. Its ability to provide a continuous view of the planet opens up possibilities for environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster response.",

    "text": "1.2 Application\nIn the practical we looked at data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2; two of the most widely used Earth observation missions that provide freely available satellite data. The ready availability of data from these missions has fundamentally changed the landscape of remote sensing research, leading to a huge increase in applications across different fields\nLandsat 8, launched in 2013, offers a spatial resolution of 30 meters and 16-day revisit intervals (“Landsat 8 | u.s. Geological Survey,” n.d.). It captures imagery across nine spectral bands using its sensor (Operational Land Imager). It differs from Sentinel-2 as it captures thermal data at a resolution of 100 meters.\nTherefore, it has become a key data source for studies requiring long-term trend analysis and surface temperature information. For instance, (Kaplan, Avdan, and Avdan 2018) utilised Landsat’s thermal bands to map urban heat islands in Skopje, tracking their expansion over multiple years. Another example is (Fahnestock et al. 2016), with their work on mapping glacier melting rates.\nSentinel-2, launched in 2015 and 2024 as a dual-satellite mission, provides a more frequent revisit time of five days and captures data across 13 spectral bands at spatial resolutions ranging from 10 to 60 meters (ESA, n.d.). The relatively short revisit period makes it ideal for near real-time monitoring of dynamic events such as natural disasters.\n(Jelének and Kopačková-Strnadová 2021), for example, showcased the effectiveness of Sentinel data in automatically detecting damage from earthquakes, providing crucial information for disaster response efforts. As well as the technical aspects of Sentinel data, they highlight its accessibility as a big asset for timely impact assessments (Jelének and Kopačková-Strnadová 2021).\nChaves et al., (2020) also notes how the red-edge bands are particularly good for assessing vegetation health, which enable researchers to detect subtle changes in plant conditions, making it useful for environmental research (Chaves, Picoli, and Sanches 2020).\nBoth Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 are great for monitoring Earth’s surface, but as mentioned in the paragraphs above, their sensors capture data slightly differently (Mandanici and Bitelli 2016). This means you need to be careful when combining data from the two sensors, taking into consideration the differences in bands and resolution.\nOverall, it is clear that this is an exciting time for remote sensing research - From a European Space Agency report, released at the beginning of 2025 research using ESA earth observation satellites has exploded since 2002 (ESSC 2025). “According to statistics provided by ESA, over 4,000 scientific publications utilising ESA and Sentinel satellites have been published in peer-reviewed journals in 2024 alone” (ESSC 2025, 42)\n\n\n\nEuropean Space Agency (ESSC 2025)\n\n\nWhilst Landsat and Sentinel satellites dominant research due to their availability, there are also plenty of private commercial earth observation missions being launched by commercial companies as shown below.\n\n\n\nEO satellite companies (Aravind 2025)",

They appear to have democratised remote sensing research, allowing for policy development and R&D in many domains including agriculture and urban planning. It lowers the barrier to entry for researchers globally, allowing for a wide range of institutions and individuals to contribute to the understanding of Earth.\nI also found a very helpful newsletter by TerraWatch Space called Last Week in Observation that releases weekly updates on the commercial and academic world in remote sensing, so I will keep an eye on that for any new research or innovations in the field.\nLooking ahead, the challenge lies in effectively translating remote sensing data into actionable policies. This week has sparked an interest in exploring how these tools and data can be applied to ongoing environmental issues. I expect these skills and this knowledge, or at least something similar, will be highly relevant and valuable in the future.\n\n\n\n\nAravind. 2025. “Last Week in Earth Observation: January 20, 2024.” https://newsletter.terrawatchspace.com/last-week-in-earth-observation-january-20-2024/.\n\n\nButcher, Ginger. 2016.

But it important to know what corrections are applied to these products.

    "text": "3.2 Application\nRemote Sensing Challenges and Corrections in Urban Environments\nI decided to focus on the distinct issues with remote sensing in urban areas, as I found that researchers often highlight challenges with collecting data in dense cities, so they often have to get creative with their solutions.\nAnd with satellite imagery being increasingly used in urban settings for detecting land use change, transport planning, environmental monitoring, it is important that these images accurately reflect the real environment (Pradhan et al. 2021).\nUrban areas often exhibit high intra-class variability, which means that similar materials appear spectrally different, due to shadows, reflective surfaces and high-rise buildings, making classification challenging (Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011).\nSome studies attempt to address this by fusing multi-angle satellite data (e.g., combining Landsat with Sentinel-2) or combining LiDAR data to create more accurate elevation models for cities. (Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011; Miliaresis and Kokkas 2007).\n(Huang, Zhang, and Gong 2011) found that the height features obtained from LiDAR data significantly improved urban land-cover classification.\nUrban areas also introduce shadowing effects, where buildings cast shadows that obscure features on the ground, making it difficult to classify land cover accurately (Dare 2005; Le and Samaras 2020). Researchers have addressed this by applying shadow detection and removal algorithms that estimate surface reflectance in obscured areas (Su et al. 2016).\nOther challenges\n\nAdjacency Effect: Reflective surfaces (e.g., glass facades) scatter light into neighbouring pixels, skewing surface reflectance values.\nThermal Anomalies: Concrete and metal structures absorb/re-radiate heat differently than natural terrain, distorting temperature measurements. Particularly impactful for urban heat island research.\n\nYet gaps remain. Most of these urban corrections don’t have out-of-the-box solution as they are computationally intensive and require localised datasets (e.g., LiDAR), perhaps limiting their real-time applications and scalability.",

Methods like DOS or PIFs make corrections more accessible, but, because they rely on assumptions – like the idea that the darkest pixel is just atmospheric noise, or that some surfaces always reflect light the same way – they have limits.\nFor exampe, in urban areas, where spectral variability is already high, these simplifications might not be suitable for detailed analysis\nThe availability of ready-to-use data is great because it saves time and effort, but also made me question the assumptions behind vendor-applied corrections. What trade-offs are hidden in these standardised products? Can we always trust them without understanding their limitations? How does it affect comparison of products? Is there a risk that users might become detached from understanding the processing, which may not be generalisable to every scenario.\nUsing LiDAR, 3D city models, and combining images from different times – as we talked about in the Applications section – shows that for cities, you often need more accuracy and context then out-of-the-box corrections.\nThis week’s work has made it clear that while pre-processed data is convenient, really understanding image correction and its details, especially for cities, is still essential for doing good and useful remote sensing work\n\n\n\n\nDare, Paul M. 2005. “Shadow Analysis in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery of Urban Areas.” Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing 71 (2): 169–77. https://doi.org/10.14358/PERS.71.2.169.\n\n\nEarth Science Data Systems, NASA. 2024. “Digital Elevation/Terrain Model (DEM) | NASA Earthdata.” https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/land-surface/digital-elevation-terrain-model-dem.\n\n\nHaque, M.

This is often corrected by using Ground Control Points (GCPs) (Jensen 2015). Ground control points are location on the Earth’s surface that can be accurately located and act as reference points (Jensen 2015). Algorithms match these GCPs in the captured image, which guide the transformations needed on the raw image to fix any distortions.\nBoth Landsat level 1 and 2 products match pixels from raw images to Earth’s coordinates using ground control points(Landsat 2021).\nHowever, the accuracy of this correction is not absolute; cloud cover, snow, or ice can obscure GCP visibility, which can limit its effectiveness in certain environments (“Landsat Levels of Processing | U.S. Geological Survey” 2017).\nAtmospheric correction:\nLight interacts with the atmosphere before reaching a sensor so particles like dust, water vapor, and pollutants scatter and absorb light, affecting the captured image quality.\nDark Object Subtraction (DOS) is a common fix, which assumes that the darkest pixel represents atmospheric noise so that value is subtracted from every pixel (Jensen 2015). Another method is using stable surfaces, like roads or rooftops, that maintain consistent reflectance over time. These are called Pseudo-invariant features (PIFs). By assuming that these features do not change between images, researchers use them to adjust images (Jensen 2015).\nThese methods are refered to as relative atmospheric correction and is often used as an estimate in the absence of synchronised surface-reflectance data(Jensen 2015).\nIn contrast, absolute atmospheric correction, exemplified by Landsat Level 2, uses external atmospheric data. Landsat uses aerosol and water vapor data from MODIS to adjust its image, rather than relying on assumptions used in relative methods (Landsat 2021).\nOrthorectification correction\nElevation distortions in imagery are corrected using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in a process called orthorectification, which ensures images appear as if viewed from directly above, removing terrain-induced geometric inaccuracies.\nHowever, tall buildings and bridges introduce their own artifacts, which are harder to correct as they are not included in standard DEMs (Earth Science Data Systems 2024).",
